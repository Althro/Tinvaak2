# Beginners guide to Tinvaak

## Abstract
> "Ah, this one needs something? Come to play Al-Tharo's Tinvaak, yes? Let Khajiit guide you through the initial steps and provide you with some important information. A word of advice, my friend; you will be glad you read this when you venture into the cold north." - S'Mardo

- *Note: The details given below are not exhaustive and many other components exist in the list which we recommend you discover.*

## Initial Setup 

### Ultrawide
For those of you with ultrawide screens, complete the following:

1. Reinstall [Dear Diary Dark Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837), saying yes to every option except `main menu background replacer`. See the picture below for the options to select on that page.

![DDDM Start Menu](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/.github/DDM.png?raw=true)

2. Activate [Oblivion Like Loading Screens 21x9](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38708)
3. Download and install [Complete Widescreen fix for SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778) & the Campfire file on the same page.
4. Close MO2. Launch BethINI from Tinvaak's Tools folder. On the Basics tab, set your resolution and enable borderless windowed mode.

### Alternate Perspective Room
> "Khajiit has heard that there are many shiny baubles in this room. You will get some of them for him, yes?"

Once all of the messages have dissappeared on screen, you will get a prompt about `Assiging your attributes` courtesy of [SkyRem AVA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23329). These points you assign to your character **are permanent**, so choose wisely!

In the chest underneath the table, there are books relating to the various classes of character you play courtesy of [ReClassified Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57527). We recommend giving that mod page a read so you can pick/get some ideas for your playstyle.

After you have created your character and followed the information given in [Post Character Creation](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2#post-character-creation), select your starting option by talking to the dragon on top of the light. If you plan on using Sunhelm, it's highly recommended that you start either in an interior or a warm location such as Falkreath or Riften.

> "This one recommends Falkreath. It is a much nicer area and will match your starting skills better. You do not want to die every few minutes, no?" - S'Mardo

Before you open and walk through the door to the right of the dragon, double check to make sure you have everything you want from the room. You will not be coming back here!

### Spawning into the world & keybinds
After you spawn into the world, configure the [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) mcm menu to your liking and also change any of the keybinds to what you fancy. By default, all keybinds are unchanged from the mod defaults, **aside from the key to hide the hud which is `numpad +`**.

The important keybinds to set include:
- True Directional Movement
- Campfire
- LXV Magicks (if you wish to use it)
- True Hud

## Gameplay
### Combat
> "S'Mardo has heard that a shield is good against archers. Too many times has this one been hurt by arrows. Pesky smoothskin bow-twangers. Fire is also a good weapon, but be careful around Khajiit. They do not want their fur singed." - S'Mardo

Right from when you move your character, you will notice that it feels very different from the base game. This is due to [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) changing how movement is done, giving you the ability to attack in any direction. Through the addition of [SkySA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31390) and the Elder Souls style animations, combat animations will feel more realistic and have many more combinations for chained attacks.

Enemies are now also much smarter and sport different resistances via the inclusion of [Know your Enemy - Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55045) & [Know your Enemy - Armor Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55203). Add to this new enemy types courtesy of [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) and [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) and your travels have just become a whole lot more dangerous. Dungeons are equally just as dangerous with [Truly Undead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12642) making those walking nightmares a lot more hellish. It's **highly recommended** you bring some silver or something flammable.

### Magic
> "This one has no skill in magic but you may fare better, yes? You can find paper and ink at merchants across Skyrim. Ri'Saad will give you a fair price." - S'Mardo

Magic has been overhauled entirely via the use of [Dino's Spell Discovery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43929?tab=description). All spell tomes have been removed from the world and you will need to study to create spells. We **highly encourage** you to read the mod page to get a full understanding of how this mod works. Any new spells you craft will feel better than vanilla. However, via the use of [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) which improves the magic system alongside staves and scrolls, [ScrollScribe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439) also allows you to create new scrolls without needing to have the levels of aptitude to join the College in Winterhold.

And for those that enjoy the slightly darker side of magic, [The Dark Arts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29834) and [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) add in a whole host of new necromantic spells and, courtesy of the latter, the ability to become a terrifying lich. 

### Levelling, crafting & Alchemy
One of the biggest changes Tinvaak makes is completely decoupling the levelling system from your character. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) changes the game so that you gain experience from exploring the world, killing enemies and completing quests. Skills are **LEVEL CAPPED** to the following:

![experience levels](https://github.com/Althro/Tinvaak2/blob/main/.github/Experience%20Levelling.png?raw=true)

[True Unleveled Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56881) changes the levelling in encounter zones so that certain areas start more deadly than others. Bandits will make for easier targets at the beginning with Dragons and vampires remaining very deadly until you attain higher skill levels. Enemies will still remain challenging with [High Level Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32801), keeping certain locations a challenge.

> "The forge warms this one's cold paws. You need to read to master the skills to be a great smith, yes? Gold solves most problems, though." - S'Mardo

Another large change that Tinvaak makes is changing crafting so that you need forging manuals to craft new items. [Heim -Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207) also makes some more tweaks to make smithing more rewarding. For those not wanting to invest in crafting, you will find forgemasters across Skyrim ready to [Hone Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) for the right price. 

Combat alchemy is now also a viable playstyle courtesy of [Badass Alchemist's Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030), which adds many new concotions to unleash upon your enemies. To quote a certain Argonian regarding this new playstyle:
> “Oh, surprised at the line being broken so easily? They don’t call me Siegebreaker for nothing, Breton. A pinch of sulphur, some powerful vinegar, a dash of ingenuity and some rags for a wick and I’ll put any Pyromancer to shame. I also do nameday parties if you can cover the cost of my ingredients and a night at the inn. Now stand back. They seem to be recovering and I have a new mixture I want to test. Got an arrow I can have? I’ll be fine but your lungs will dissolve like sweetroll frosting on a hot day if you get anywhere near this.” – Upon Further Reflection

### Survival
> "The Wind blows bitter cold in this place." - S'Mardo

Survival is a major focus of Tinvaak but is designed to be non-intrusive in its approach. You need to prepare for your journey and be wary as with [Harsher Sunhelm Cold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63548) you can die if you ignore the lingering cold. [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667/) adds camping mechanics which, when combined with [LVX Magicks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11001) and [Decorator Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11708) allow you to create your own unique campsites ranging from simple tents to your own full blown estate.

-*Note: If you plan on spawning large structures, save and reload the game once they have spawned in. Failure to do so may result in corrupted save files.*

[Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) and [Incremental Injuries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55114) handle the bulk of the survival integration with the former changing the game so that you need to sleep, drink and eat to maintain peak physical condition. The latter makes it so that you must rest after a hard days adventuring to regain your health, magicka and stamina values. If you don't rest, those values will continue to detriorate to the limit set in the ini file (50%).

[Potion Toxicity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32576) also changes up potions so that if you abuse potions your character will become addicted to them. You will need to think twice before chugging health potions; they may cause you more damage than you realise...

## Friends
> "S'mardo has encountered many people in Skyrim. Some friendlier than most.." - S'Mardo

Skyrim can be a lonely place, and the battles can be tough. Thankfully, there are a few new followers that are ready and willing to carry your burdens without complaining about them.

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking, he won't chatter, and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in Archery, One-Handed, and Sneak. 

3. [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164). Feel as though there's not enough dogs in Skyrim? Well, now you can have your own unique corgi which will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

4. [Shirley](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45956), the beloved Skyrim Grandma, finally comes to the game as a follower you can recruit! She'll join you on your adventures, but don't expect her to simply carry your burdens!

5. [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433). Still not enough corgi in your Skyrim? Well, then you'll want to take this loveable and magical pup on the road with you! A unique combat-oriented corgi follower that will be sure to set your enemies ablaze with glee!
