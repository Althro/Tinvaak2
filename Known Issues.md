### **Known Issues**

- **Draugr are overrunning skyrim** (visual bug with Draugr like looking NPCs. The fix is shown in the picture below outlined in the red box)

- **Rugged Rogue - Skirt w/ Vest Missing Mesh** (This is an unfortunate oversight by the Mod Author and while we can fix it, it won't come until the next update.)
- **Tempering doesn't need any requirements or materials for some items** (will be addressed in a future update, it's easy to overlook some recipes by the amount of items that are in the list)
- **Left Handed magic does not work** (This is a known issue with SkySA and we are not able to fix this sadly)
- **Visual bug in Cronvangr cave** (This is due to a conflict between LUX and one of the occlusion planes added by the Skyrim Optimization mod. Will be fixed in 3.0)
- **Whenever I cast a spell I start glowing/visual effects/light flares** (This occurs when you store any two-handed spells (spells equipped on both left and right hand; e.g. most master-level spells) in your Spellcrafting Grimoire. To fix, extract such spells from your grimoire.)
- **Clannfear summon from ODIN doesn't attack**. We're looking into that but for now the Ai seems broken on that summon.
