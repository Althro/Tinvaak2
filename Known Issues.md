### **Known Issues**


- **Performance Issues** (Fix is linked in the discord server, please join it and look up the channel #tinvaak-known-bugs-and-fixes)
- **Lockpicking Skill not leveling** (Download the patchfile in the discord server and follow the instructions to install it)
- **Dusk Pitch Black w/ ENB** (fix is linked in the server as well)
- **Draugr are overrunning skyrim** (visual bug with Draugr like looking NPCs. The fix is linked in the known-bugs-and-fixes channel in the server as well)
- **Rugged Rogue - Skirt w/ Vest Missing Mesh** (This is an unfortunate oversight by the Mod Author and while we can fix it, it won't come until the next update.)
- **Building inside the Winking Skeever** (Probably due to a misclick while making a patch, click on it with the console open and type 'disable')
- **Mihail Guar Peddlar overly aggressive and causing CTDs** (fix can be found in the known-bugs-and-fixes channel in the server)
- **Tempering doesn't need any requirements or materials for some items** (will be addressed in a future update, it's easy to overlook some recipes by the amount of items that are in the list)
