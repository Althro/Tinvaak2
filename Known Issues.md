### **Known Issues**


- **Performance Issues** (Fix is linked in the discord server, please join it and look up the channel #tinvaak-known-bugs-and-fixes)
- **Lockpicking Skill not leveling** (Download the patchfile in the discord server and follow the instructions to install it)
- **Dusk Pitch Black w/ ENB** (fix is linked in the server as well)
- **Draugr are overrunning skyrim** (visual bug with Draugr like looking NPCs. The fix is linked in the known-bugs-and-fixes channel in the server as well)
- **Rugged Rogue - Skirt w/ Vest Missing Mesh** (This is an unfortunate oversight by the Mod Author and while we can fix it, it won't come until the next update.)
- **Building inside the Winking Skeever** (Probably due to a misclick while making a patch, click on it with the console open and type 'disable')
- **Mihail Guar Peddlar overly aggressive and causing CTDs** (fix can be found in the known-bugs-and-fixes channel in the server)
- **Tempering doesn't need any requirements or materials for some items** (will be addressed in a future update, it's easy to overlook some recipes by the amount of items that are in the list)
- **Standing Stones in Skyrim Unbound's MCM give the vanilla effect** (Yes the effects are not patched and you get the vanilla effects from that menu. You can still get the modded standing stone effects if you activate the stones in the world but the vanilla ones won't get overwritten by them. You end up with 2 sets of effects)
-  **Werewolf transformations crash/freeze the game occasionally** (We are looking into it, expect it to be fixed in an future update of the list)
