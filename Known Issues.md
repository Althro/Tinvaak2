### **Known Issues**

- **Draugr are overrunning skyrim** (visual bug with Draugr like looking NPCs. The fix is linked in the known-bugs-and-fixes channel in the server as well)
- **Rugged Rogue - Skirt w/ Vest Missing Mesh** (This is an unfortunate oversight by the Mod Author and while we can fix it, it won't come until the next update.)
- **Tempering doesn't need any requirements or materials for some items** (will be addressed in a future update, it's easy to overlook some recipes by the amount of items that are in the list)
